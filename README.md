An analysis of layoffs from companies worldwide during the Covid era.

Steps I used:
1. Data cleaning: To get ait in a more usable format. This involved removing duplicates, standardizing the data
and handling null values.
2. Data analysis: Actual analysis performed on the cleaned data

Functions used:
1. Aggregate functions: Sum, Count, Min, Max
2. String functions: Trim; to remove any leading or trailing spaces and Substring to extract a portion of a string.
3. Ranking functions: Rank; to assign  a rank to each distinct value within rows and Row Number; to assign a unique
number incrementally to each row in a result set.

SQL Statements:
Data Definition Language: Create, Alter, Drop
Data Manipulation Language: Select, Insert, Update, Delete

SQL Clauses: Where, Group By, Order By used to filter and sort the data.

TRY_CONVERT: To convert a value from one data type to another.
Common Table Expressions (CTE): To simplify complex queries and improve readablility
